Powered by Hono, Hono/GraphQL-Server, and GraphQL.js

I wrote an article about making a graphql server with bun [here](https://groff.dev/bun-graphql/)

## Run Instructions
```bash
bun install
bun index.js
```

The GraphQL Server should be running on the environment variable `PORT` or `3000` if not set.
